### Roadmap

This course was originally taught as CS 537 at the University of Wisconsin by the author of the OSTEP textbook, so the projects are assigned in the course according to the best times to give UWisconsin students access to on-campus resources like recitation sections and office hours. That means they don't match up perfectly with the material being covered at that time in the lectures or textbook chapters. We recommend doing the course in the following order instead.

* Read chapters 1 and 2 of the OSTEP textbook and watch the first half (the introduction) of lecture 1.
* Do the `initial-utilities` project; it's intended as a litmus test for you to make sure you're comfortable enough with C before taking this class. You can watch discussion 1 for help. If it takes you more than 2 hours to write the code (not counting the discussion time and any time spent debugging), you should consider spending more time learning C before moving on in the course. (If you want more practice, you can do `initial-reverse` too, but it's not required.)
* Watch lectures 1 through 5 and read chapters 3 through 24 of the OSTEP textbook. We recommend doing the homework assignments as they come up in the course calendar or book chapters.
* Watch discussion 3 and reread chapter 5, then do the `processes-shell` project.
* Read the annotated guide to xv6 linked in the resources section below, starting from the beginning and stopping after the `System Calls: Processes` section.
* Watch discussion 2, then do the `initial-xv6` project.
* Watch discussion 5, then do the `scheduling-xv6-lottery` project.
* Watch discussion 7, then do the `vm-xv6-intro` project.
* Watch lectures 6 through 9 (and optionally, the review lecture) and read chapters 25 through 34; again, you're encouraged to do the homework.
* Watch discussion 10, then do the `concurency-xv6-threads` project.
* Watch discussions 11 and 12, then do the `concurrency-mapreduce` project.
* Watch lectures 10 through 14 (and optionally, the second review lecture) and read chapters 35 through 47; remember to do the homework along with the lectures or chapters.
* Do the `filesystems-checker` project.

Reading order:
- Before starting the course: initial-utilities (aka, project 1a) and initial-reverse (not assigned in class)
- Chapter 5: processes-shell (project 2a)
- Chapter 6: initial-xv6 (project 1b, but only worry about test 1)
- Chapter 9: scheduling-xv6-lottery (project 2b)
- Chapter 24: vm-xv6-intro (project 3b)
- Chapter 28: initial-xv6 (now pass test 2)
- Chapter 29: concurrency-xv6-threads (project 4b)
- Chapter 30: concurrency-mapreduce (project 4a)
- Chapter 33: concurrency-webserver (not assigned in class)
- Chapter 42: filesystems-checker (project 5a)
- (there is no 5b, and there are no projects for chapters 43-51)
